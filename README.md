# ðŸ’¨ WiFan 

This manual is made for an IoT schoolproject. I've created an IoT fan called WiFan. You can controll the fan using an app, a voice assistant, or you can connect it to a weather API to turn on when the temperature rises. In this manual I will show you how I connected my fan to an open weather API using a NodeMCU ESP8266.

The manual will be divided into 4 main sections.
1. Setting up the Microcontroller & Relay
2. Connecting the Microcontroller & Relay to your fan
3. Using an open weather API to get your outside temperature
4. Putting everything together to make a working product

## Prerequisites
